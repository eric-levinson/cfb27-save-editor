# Safety boundary

CFB27 Lua Hook is for a separately launched offline game session. It does not
provide, distribute, or document an anticheat bypass.

## Installation safety

- Close the game before installing or restoring the MMC startup proxy.
- Both original MMC `CryptBase.dll` files are checksum-verified and preserved
  as `MMCBase.dll` before replacement.
- Unknown active proxies or backups are never overwritten.
- A failed install restores both verified MMC proxies.
- Do not disable or allowlist antivirus protection for this project.

## Runtime write gates

`cfb.write_u8` rejects a write unless all of these conditions hold:

1. The process is the exact supported CFB27 executable build.
2. No real EA anticheat or Javelin process is detected.
3. The address belongs to committed writable memory.
4. The current byte equals the caller's expected byte.
5. Readback equals the requested replacement byte.

An unsupported build may load the host for diagnostics, but writes stay
disabled. The native `writeTransaction` command preserves the exact-build and
anticheat gates, validates and compares every operation before writing, applies
and verifies in request order, and rolls attempted operations back in reverse
order after an apply or verification failure.

Transaction sequencing is not game-thread atomicity. The host does not suspend
the game or provide a stable snapshot; callers must establish a stable window
for the targeted data. If rollback verification fails, the host permanently
sets `sessionWritesDisabled`, and both `writeTransaction` and `cfb.write_u8`
reject all further writes until the process restarts. Integrations should call
`hello`, inspect `writesAllowed`, check `status.sessionWritesDisabled`, and
handle the transaction's verified status explicitly.

The typed FrTk protocol is stricter than the raw memory surface. Profile and
layout load as one validated bundle, public table selectors use Unique IDs,
and discovery installs no partial catalog. Explicit transitions, save changes,
shutdown, and `game_ready:false` stale the catalog generation.

Typed responses omit process addresses, raw bytes, patterns, masks, offsets,
ranges, and transaction plans. Typed writes accept only logical
Unique-ID/row/field/value changes, reread live records, and use the existing
guarded engine. Non-`direct_verified` authority fails closed before planning;
rollback failure still disables raw, typed, and Lua writes for the session.

`CFB27_SMOKE_ALLOW_WRITES=1` is a native test gate recognized only when the
hosting executable is exactly `cfb27_protocol_smoke.exe`. It does not enable
writes in the game, MMC, or any other executable.
