# CFB27 Save Editor

Local web app for inspecting and editing EA SPORTS College Football 27 save files.

The app runs on a Python stdlib HTTP server with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It handles the outer `FBCHUNKS` container in Python and uses `madden-franchise` for structured FrTk table reads/writes.

## Current Editing Support

- Top-level save files only; backup folders and nested paths are rejected.
- Timestamped backup before every write.
- Roster TLV string edits for known-safe player fields.
- Structured dynasty recruit editing through joined `Recruit` and `Player` tables:
  - national rank
  - position rank
  - state rank
  - first name
  - last name
  - position
  - height in inches
  - weight in pounds
  - head asset
- Skin tone and hair hints are decoded from the head asset name when present, but remain read-only until the `CharacterVisuals.RawData` offsets are verified.

## Local Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js
- `npm install`
- Generated local schema files in `schema/`, especially `CFB27_schema_for_madden_franchise.gz`

Generated schema and save-derived files are intentionally ignored by Git. They come from the local game install and local saves, and should stay on the machine that owns them.
